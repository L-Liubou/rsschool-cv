### ABOUT ME
As an aspiring frontend developer, my goal is to translate ideas and requirements into well-thought-out, easily recognizable interfaces. Working at the intersection of creativity and technology inspires me, where programming, design, and user experience come together to create user-friendly and attractive products. I strive to find the balance between aesthetics, functionality, and simplicity, ensuring that every element of interaction is meaningful and effective.

>a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent.

```  
function powerOfTwo(n) {
  return (n > 0) && ((n & (n-1)) === 0)
}
