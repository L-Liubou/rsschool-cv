#### ABOUT ME
A highly motivated and adaptable person with a background in medicine and six years of experience in pharmacy. After realizing my passion lies elsewhere, I transitioned to frontend development to harness my creative potential. 
I am committed to continuous learning and skill development, and I am particularly drawn to remote work opportunities. I would like to contribute to projects related to medicine or cosmetology.
