### CODE EXAMPLE

Complete the function powerOfTwo that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two. From the corresponding Wikipedia entry:
>a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent.

```  
function powerOfTwo(n) {
  return (n > 0) && ((n & (n-1)) === 0)
}
```
